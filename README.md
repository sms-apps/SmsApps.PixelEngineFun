# SmsApps.PixelEngineFun
Having fun using the Pixel-Engine as forked from https://github.com/ninjapretzel/Pixel-Engine, which is a C# port https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine.

Libraries is the folder containing the actual C# port of Pixel-Engine in DLL form. All I've done there is copied over the .DLL, .PDB and .XML files from the Libraries folder in that repo and dropped them into the solution, then referenced them in the main project.

SmsApps.PixelEngineFun\Program.cs is just where I'm newing up the latest example I'm working on.

SmsApps.PixelEngineFun\Examples is where you'll find the various ports of OLC's latest work.

Thanks
